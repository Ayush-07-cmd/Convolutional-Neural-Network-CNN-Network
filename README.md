# 🧠 CNN Image Classification using TensorFlow & Keras

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, designed to classify images effectively. The project is structured in a Jupyter Notebook format, making it beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Image preprocessing using TensorFlow Datasets
- ✅ CNN architecture using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense` layers
- ✅ Training and validation with visualizations
- ✅ Evaluation with accuracy metrics
- ✅ Easily customizable for other image datasets

## 📁 Files

- `CNN_network.ipynb` - The main notebook containing the complete pipeline from data loading to evaluation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- NumPy

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this notebook on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
    ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash

    ```

## 🧪 Example Results

> Include a screenshot here of the accuracy/loss graph and a confusion matrix if possible!

## 📈 Training Logs

- Training Accuracy: ~XX%
- Validation Accuracy: ~XX%
- Number of Epochs: 10 (can be adjusted)

## ✨ Customization

You can easily swap out the dataset for another image dataset. Just modify the `tf.keras.datasets` or use `tf.data` pipeline to load custom images.
